### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Bern working on legal NLP. Previously, I studied Computer Science with a focus on Data Science. My overarching research project studies the re-identification and anonymization of Swiss court decisions. In this blog, I summarize and comment on research papers in legal NLP for a wider audience outside of NLP. Sometimes I also write technical tutorials for NLP researchers and practitioners.
